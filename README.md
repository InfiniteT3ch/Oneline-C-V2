Oneline C-v2
==============================================================================

Oneline Cv2 is the oneline server re-written in pure C. It provides the same
usage  as  Oneline v1, (receivers, starts and ends), however it is more lightweight,
and does NOT use an external HTTP server, even more uses the Python C API for
all Python interop. Is a work in progress 

Migrating
